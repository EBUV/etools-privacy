        <h2><img src="PlaceBetweenPoints.png" class="icon" alt="">Place Between Two Points</h2>
        <p>This tool allows you to place a selected family instance at the midpoint between two picked points in the model.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can either pre-select the object to be copied or launch the command and then select it when prompted.</li>
            <li>After selecting the source element, pick two points in the model. The new instance will be placed at the midpoint.</li>
            <li>Works with face-based and non-hosted families.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The selected object must be a family instance that can be placed manually. Face-based families require a valid face during placement.

    <div class="section">
        <h2><img src="PlaceArrayBetweenTwoPoints.png" class="icon" alt="">Place Array Between Two Points</h2>
        <p>This tool allows you to create a rectangular array of a selected family instance between two picked points, with a specified number of rows and columns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can pre-select the source object or select it after launching the command.</li>
            <li>After starting the command, you will be asked to enter the number of rows and columns.</li>
            <li>Then, pick two points in the model. These define the rectangular area for the array.</li>
            <li>The tool calculates the spacing and places the copies evenly across the area, using a margin of x ⁄ 2 from the edges and a distance of x between the elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The original object will not be moved or deleted. Spacing is automatically calculated based on the total area and instance count.
